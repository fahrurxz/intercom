# Intercom

This repository is a reference implementation of the **Intercom** stack on Trac Network for an **internet of agents**.

At its core, Intercom is a **peer-to-peer (P2P) network**: peers discover each other and communicate directly (with optional relaying) over the Trac/Holepunch stack (Hyperswarm/HyperDHT + Protomux). There is no central server required for sidechannel messaging.

## Competition Checklist (Intercom Vibe)
- **Fork repo:** `https://github.com/fahrurxz/intercom`
- **Custom app name:** `Intercom Project Status`
- **Trac address (payout):** `trac1pxav50t6mhran2tf0dnvehg3tgpc2l05pc508zux50x46l07a0kqfdn74w`
- **Proof that app works:** see `proof/` folder (logs + screenshot artifacts)
  - Runtime log: `proof/run.log`
  - Runtime screenshot: `proof/run-screenshot.png`
  - Protocol mapping proof: `proof/command-mapping.log`
  - Runtime tx simulation proof: `proof/tx-sim.log`

### Custom app changes in this fork
- Added contract command `set_project_status` to store app status on replicated state.
- Added contract read command `read_project_status` to read the last status update.
- Updated protocol command mapping and CLI help for these custom commands.
- Competition tx examples:
  - `/tx --command '{"op":"set_project_status","status":"MVP ready","note":"first demo"}'`
  - `/tx --command "read_project_status"`

Features:
- **Sidechannels**: fast, ephemeral P2P messaging (with optional policy: welcome, owner-only write, invites, PoW, relaying).
- **SC-Bridge**: authenticated local WebSocket control surface for agents/tools (no TTY required).
- **Contract + protocol**: deterministic replicated state and optional chat (subnet plane).
- **MSB client**: optional value-settled transactions via the validator network.

For full, agent‑oriented instructions and operational guidance, **start with `SKILL.md`**.  
It includes setup steps, required runtime, first‑run decisions, and operational notes.

## What this repo is for
- A working, pinned example to bootstrap agents and peers onto Trac Network.
- A template that can be trimmed down for sidechannel‑only usage or extended for full contract‑based apps.

## How to use
Use the **Pear runtime only** (never native node).  
Follow the steps in `SKILL.md` to install dependencies, run the admin peer, and join peers correctly.

## Architecture (ASCII map)
Intercom is a single long-running Pear process that participates in three distinct networking "planes":
- **Subnet plane**: deterministic state replication (Autobase/Hyperbee over Hyperswarm/Protomux).
- **Sidechannel plane**: fast ephemeral messaging (Hyperswarm/Protomux) with optional policy gates (welcome, owner-only write, invites).
- **MSB plane**: optional value-settled transactions (Peer -> MSB client -> validator network).

  Optional for local testing:
  - --dht-bootstrap "<host:port,host:port>" overrides the peer's HyperDHT bootstraps
    (all peers that should discover each other must use the same list).

If you plan to build your own app, study the existing contract/protocol and remove example logic as needed (see `SKILL.md`).
